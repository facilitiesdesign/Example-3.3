# Example-3.3

Consider Example 3.2. In addition to Atlanta, Seers Inc. is considering another 
locationâ€”Pittsburgh. The expected demand at the four distribution centers and 
the maximum capacity at the Albany and Little Rock plants are given in Table 3.10. 
Notice that a plant of any size can be built at both locations, so that the theoretical capacity of plants at the new locations is infinite. Determine which of the two 
locations, Atlanta or Pittsburgh, is suitable for the new plant.
